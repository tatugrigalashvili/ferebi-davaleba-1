    <h3 class="satauri1">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3> 
    <p class="paragrapi1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br>
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
